# Aqualyn - Production-Grade Scalable Messaging Platform

## 1. Executive Summary & Vision
**Aqualyn** is designed to be a world-class, highly scalable messaging and social platform, targeting a global user base of **2 billion (200cr) users**. Our vision is to combine the fluid, aesthetic "Liquid UI" with a distributed, consistent, and resilient backend architecture capable of handling massive concurrent traffic, similar to industry leaders like Telegram and WhatsApp.

## 2. Product Requirements Document (PRD)

### 2.1 Core Objectives
- **Global Scalability**: Support 2B+ users with sub-100ms message delivery latency.
- **Multi-Platform Presence**: 
  - **Web**: High-performance SPA.
  - **Mobile**: Native Android (APK) and iOS applications.
  - **Distribution**: Dedicated landing page for direct APK downloads and updates.
- **High Availability**: 99.99% uptime through multi-region distributed systems.
- **Security**: End-to-End Encryption (E2EE) and robust privacy controls.

### 2.2 Key Features
- **Instant Messaging**: Real-time text, high-quality voice notes, and large file sharing (up to 2GB).
- **Advanced Groups & Channels**: Support for groups with up to 200,000 members and broadcast channels with unlimited subscribers.
- **Secret Chats**: E2EE chats with self-destruct timers and screenshot protection.
- **Stories 2.0**: Immersive, expiring media sharing with advanced editing tools, music, and interactive stickers.
- **Liquid UI Customization**: Deep theme engine, adjustable "Aqua Intensity", and modular layout controls.
- **Security Suite**: App Lock, Archive Lock (PIN-protected), and two-step verification.

## 3. System Design & Architecture (Production Level)

### 3.1 High-Level Architecture
Aqualyn follows a **Distributed Microservices Architecture** deployed across multiple global regions to ensure low latency and high fault tolerance.

#### Traffic Management
- **Global Load Balancing**: AWS Route53 for Geo-DNS and AWS Global Accelerator to route traffic to the nearest healthy edge location.
- **API Gateway**: Centralized entry point for rate limiting, authentication, and request routing.

#### Real-Time Communication (RTC)
- **WebSocket Cluster**: A distributed cluster of WebSocket servers handling persistent connections.
- **Presence Service**: High-performance service tracking user online/offline status using Redis.
- **Message Broker**: **Apache Kafka** for asynchronous message processing, push notifications, and analytics.

### 3.2 Data Layer & Consistency
To handle 2B users, we employ a multi-tier storage strategy:

- **Metadata (Users, Groups)**: **Sharded PostgreSQL** (AWS RDS) for strong consistency and complex queries.
- **Message History**: **ScyllaDB** or **Cassandra** for high-throughput, horizontally scalable writes and low-latency reads.
- **Caching**: **Redis (AWS ElastiCache)** for session management, presence data, and frequently accessed metadata.
- **Media Storage**: **AWS S3** with **CloudFront CDN** for global media delivery and caching.

### 3.3 Scalability Strategies
- **Database Sharding**: Horizontal partitioning of data based on `user_id` to prevent single-node bottlenecks.
- **Horizontal Scaling**: All microservices are containerized (Docker) and managed by **Kubernetes (AWS EKS)** for automatic scaling based on CPU/Memory metrics.
- **Read Replicas**: Distributed read-only database nodes to handle heavy read traffic.

## 4. Tech Stack

### 4.1 Frontend & Mobile
- **Web App**: React 19, Tailwind CSS 4, Motion (Liquid UI Engine).
- **Mobile (APK)**: **React Native** or **Flutter** for cross-platform native performance.
- **APK Landing Page**: Static Next.js site optimized for SEO and fast downloads.

### 4.2 Backend & Infrastructure
- **Languages**: Node.js (TypeScript) for API services, Go/Rust for high-performance RTC components.
- **Server**: Express.js / Fastify.
- **Real-time**: Distributed WebSockets with Redis Pub/Sub.
- **Cloud Provider**: **AWS** (Primary) or **Vercel** (for frontend/landing pages).
- **Containerization**: Docker & Kubernetes (EKS).

### 4.3 Security & Compliance
- **Encryption**: Signal Protocol for E2EE, AES-256 for data at rest.
- **DDoS Protection**: AWS Shield & WAF.
- **Auth**: JWT-based stateless authentication with refresh tokens and hardware-backed security.

## 5. Deployment & DevOps (Scalable Pipeline)

### 5.1 CI/CD Pipeline
- **Automated Testing**: Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests (Cypress/Playwright) running on every PR.
- **Blue-Green Deployment**: Zero-downtime deployments using Kubernetes ingress controllers.
- **Canary Releases**: Gradual rollout of new features to a small percentage of users.

### 5.2 Monitoring & Observability
- **Metrics**: **Prometheus** & **Grafana** for real-time system health dashboards.
- **Logging**: **ELK Stack** (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for centralized log analysis.
- **Tracing**: **Jaeger** or **AWS X-Ray** for distributed request tracing across microservices.

## 6. Roadmap to 2B Users
1. **Phase 1 (MVP)**: Finalize Liquid UI, basic messaging, and mock backend.
2. **Phase 2 (Beta)**: Transition to Firebase for real-time sync and initial user testing.
3. **Phase 3 (Scale)**: Migrate to AWS EKS, implement ScyllaDB for message history, and launch the APK distribution site.
4. **Phase 4 (Global)**: Multi-region deployment, E2EE implementation, and global marketing launch.
